Hey. Name's Lojemiru. I'm a hobbyist game developer, occasional musician, and aspiring cybersecurity major (or whatever it is that college students who want to pretend their degree is meaningful say).

I'm currently leading development for the [AM2R Community Updates](https://www.github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers) and working on some personal projects. I used to develop in GameMaker Studio 2, and am now developing my own engine based on the MonoGame framework.

That's it, that's the README. Go look at a repository or get off my abstract digital lawn.
