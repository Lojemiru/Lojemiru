Hey. Name's Lojemiru. I'm a hobbyist game developer, occasional musician, and aspiring cybersecurity major (or whatever it is that college students who want to pretend their degree is meaningful say).

I'm currently leading development for the [AM2R Community Updates](https://www.github.com/AM2R-Community-Developers) and working on some personal projects. I primarily develop games in GameMaker: Studio 2, but I'm learning C# and use it for most utility programming. I'll tackle the GUI-infested nightmare that is Unity at some point in the future.

That's it, that's the README. Go look at a repository or get off my abstract digital lawn.
